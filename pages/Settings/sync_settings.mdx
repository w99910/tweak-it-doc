# Sync Settings

This feature is useful when 

- you use multiple browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Arc, etc. 
- you use multiple devices such as desktop, laptop.
- you want to centralize your settings, your custom styles and your applied styles.

When you turned off the feature, our extension will still remember your applied styles, custom styles and settings but when you either remove the extension or clear cache, those data will be gone.
