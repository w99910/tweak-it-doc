# Creating your custom style

When you finish tweaking settings for your style, you need to create style in order to use it later.

- Click `Create Style` at the bottom right of the extension modal.

![Create Style](../../public/custom-style/create-style.png)

- A prompt will be shown and enter your custom name. 

<Callout type="warning">
  As for now, if you want to change the style name later, you need to create a new one. So make sure that you provide your favourite style name.
</Callout>

![Enter name](../../public/custom-style/enter-name.png)

- You should be able to see it in the `preset styles` tab.
