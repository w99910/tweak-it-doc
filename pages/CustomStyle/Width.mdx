# Width

This feature is used to change the website layout width. This feature is initially intended to change Medium article width since the width is relatively small on bigger screen.
As far as I know, it works on some websites such as Medium and Amazon.com

<Callout type="warning">
  This feature could break website layout. 
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  In order to reset the width, leave the input box as blank.
</Callout>
