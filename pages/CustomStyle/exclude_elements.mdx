# Exclude Elements

Sometimes, you might want to exclude some elements from being applied by the extension. Excluding element is a bit tricky. Thus, please use appropriate methods based on your scenarios.

### Add Element

When you cannot select element such as hidden popover, you can use this feature. You can provide style selector name such as [class name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class) or [id](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) of the elements you want to exclude.

  For example, let me show how I exclude background color of Youtube Profile PopUp from being applied in transparent mode.

  - I inspect the element by right clicking on the modal and click `Inspect`. 
  - Search for the main element where background color is being applied.
  - Then get selector name `ytd-multi-page-menu-renderer` of the style.

### Select Element

This method is easy and straightforward but you need to select the exact element to exclude. This method exludes the selected element and [its children](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_combinator) from being applied by the extension. If the extension is not excluding the element, you should check if you have selected the correct element by inspecting it ( using the method 1.)

<Callout type="warning">
  Please note that this method could trigger performance issue if you select the parent element of many children. Thus, please select the element wisely.
