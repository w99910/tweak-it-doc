# Cursor Hover

In order to set the cursor style when you hover a button or a link, you can use the `cursor hover` property. If you don't set the cursor, the default cursor will be displayed.

The usage is similar to `Cursor`. Example usage will be as follows:

### Setting Cursor to Predefined Keyword

- Copy the code below and paste the keyword to the `cursor` value.

```CSS
wait
```

### Setting Cursor to Image

- Find the image you want to set as cursor. ( I recommend you to find icon image. )
- Right click on the image and select `Copy Image Address`.
- Copy the code below and paste the image address to the `image_address` value inside `url`.

```CSS
url("image_address") 16 16, auto;
```

Example

```CSS
url("https://img.icons8.com/?size=32&id=fu6HjyEes37m&format=png") 16 16, auto
```
